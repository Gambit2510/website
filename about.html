    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a kid that likes to experiment with random things like HTML, Minecraft, Garry's Mod, CSS, Hammer, Source Engine, and much more.
        I usually sit on my computer most of the time just playing games, but sometimes I make videos and program. If you are wondering here are my setup specs.
        My PC is a ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with 8GBs DDR4 of ram and a Geforce GTX 1650, AMD Ryzen 5 x64 6cores. That's all for now.
